The Instrument Simulator
========================

Running the Instrument Simulator
--------------------------------

The end product of a mock observation is a "standard" event file which has been 
convolved with a model for the telescope. In SOXS, this is handled by the
instrument simulator. 

:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` reads in a SIMPUT catalog and creates a
standard event file using the instrument simulator. :func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`
performs the following actions:

1. Uses the effective area curve to determine which events will actually be detected.
2. Projects these events onto the detector plane and perform PSF blurring and dithering 
   of their positions.
3. Add particle/instrumental and astrophysical background events.
4. Convolves the event energies with the response matrix to produce channels.
5. Writes everything to an event file.

All of the photon lists in the SIMPUT catalog will be processed. A typical invocation of 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` looks like the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import instrument_simulator
    simput_file = "snr_simput.fits" # SIMPUT file to be read
    out_file = "evt_mucal.fits" # event file to be written
    exp_time = 30000. # The exposure time in seconds
    instrument = "mucal" # short name for instrument to be used
    sky_center = [30., 45.] # RA, Dec of pointing in degrees
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center, clobber=True)
 
The ``clobber`` argument allows an existing file to be overwritten.

.. _instrument-arg:

The ``instrument`` Argument
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SOXS currently supports instrument configurations for *Lynx* and *Athena* "out of the box". Any
of these can be specified with the ``instrument`` argument:

Lynx
~~~~

For *Lynx*, there are currently two base instruments, ``"hdxi"`` for the High-Definition X-ray 
Imager, and ``"mucal"`` for the microcalorimeter. There are also variations on these instruments which
use different mirror parameters. The different variations on mirror parameters available are:

* :math:`d` = 3 m, :math:`f` = 10 m (default case)
* :math:`d` = 3 m, :math:`f` = 15 m
* :math:`d` = 3 m, :math:`f` = 20 m
* :math:`d` = 6 m, :math:`f` = 20 m

Where :math:`d` is the diameter of the outermost mirror shell, and :math:`f` is the focal length. To use a different
case other than the default, append it to the instrument string in a ``dxf`` pattern, e.g. ``"hdxi_3x20"``, ``"mucal_6x20"``.

Athena
~~~~~~

For simulating *Athena* observations, two instrument specifications are available, for the WFI (Wide-Field 
Imager) and the X-IFU (X-ray Integral Field Unit). For both of these specifications, a 12 meter focal length
is assumed, along with a 5-arcsecond Gaussian PSF, and observations are not dithered. For more information
about the specification of the *Athena* instruments assumed here, consult 
`the Athena simulation tools web portal <http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/resources/simulation-tools.html>`_.

.. _other-mods:

Other Modifications
+++++++++++++++++++

You can also change other aspects of the observation with :func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`.
For example, you can change the shape and size of the dither pattern. The default dither pattern is a 
square of width 16.0 arcseconds on a side. You can change it to be a circle dither pattern or turn off
dithering entirely:

.. code-block:: python

    # this invocation makes the dither shape a circle and sets the radius to 8 arcsec
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, dither_shape="circle", 
                         dither_size=8.0)
    
.. code-block:: python

    # this invocation turns off dithering entirely
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, dither_shape=None) 

You can also specify a non-zero roll angle:

.. code-block:: python

    # adds a roll of 45.0 degrees
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, roll_angle=45.0) 

.. note:: 

    Dithering will only be enabled if the instrument specification allows for it. For *Lynx*,
    dithering is on by default, but for *Athena* it is off. 

The astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds can be turned on and off using the ``astro_bkgnd``
and ``instr_bkgnd`` arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    # decreases the particle background intensity by half
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True, instr_bkgnd=False,
                         astro_bkgnd=True) 

Finally, to simulate an observation of backgrounds only without a source, simply run 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` with ``None`` as the argument for the ``simput_file``:

.. code-block:: python

    # simulates backgrounds only
    instrument_simulator(None, "bkg_evt.fits", exp_time, instrument, 
                         sky_center, clobber=True)

.. _instrument-registry:

Creating New Instrument Specifications
--------------------------------------

SOXS provides the ability to customize the models of the different components of the instrument being
simulated. This is provided by the use of the instrument registry and JSON files which contain prescriptions
for different instrument configurations.

The Instrument Registry
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The instrument registry is simply a Python dictionary containing various instrument specifications. You
can see the contents of the instrument registry by calling :func:`~soxs.instrument.show_instrument_registry`:

.. code-block:: python

    import soxs
    soxs.show_instrument_registry()

gives (showing only a subset for brevity):

.. code-block:: pycon

    Instrument: hdxi
        num_pixels: 4096
        fov: 5.0
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: hdxi_3x10
        arf: xrs_hdxi_3x10.arf
        rmf: xrs_hdxi.rmf
        focal_length: 10.0
        dither: True
    Instrument: mucal
        num_pixels: 300
        fov: 5.0
        bkgnd: mucal
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: mucal_3x10
        arf: xrs_mucal_3x10.arf
        rmf: xrs_mucal.rmf
        focal_length: 10.0
        dither: True
    Instrument: mucal_3x15
        num_pixels: 300
        fov: 5.0
        bkgnd: mucal
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: mucal_3x15
        arf: xrs_mucal_3x15.arf
        rmf: xrs_mucal.rmf
        focal_length: 15.0
        dither: True
    Instrument: hdxi_3x15
        num_pixels: 4096
        fov: 20.0
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: hdxi_3x15
        arf: xrs_hdxi_3x15.arf
        rmf: xrs_hdxi.rmf
        focal_length: 15.0
        dither: True
    Instrument: hdxi_3x10
        num_pixels: 4096
        fov: 20.0
        bkgnd: acisi
        psf: ['gaussian', 0.5]
        name: hdxi_3x10
        arf: xrs_hdxi_3x10.arf
        rmf: xrs_hdxi.rmf
        focal_length: 10.0
        dither: True
    ...

The various parts of each instrument specification are:

* ``"name"``: The name of the instrument specification. 
* ``"arf"``: The file containing the ARF.
* ``"num_pixels"``: The number of resolution elements on a side of the field of view.
* ``"bkgnd"``: The name of the instrumental background to use, stored in the background registry
  (see :ref:`background` for more details).
* ``"psf"``: The PSF specification to use. At time of writing, the only one available is that of
  a Gaussian PSF, with a single parameter, the HPD of the PSF. This is specified using a Python
  list, e.g. ``["gaussian", 0.5]``
* ``"rmf"``: The file containing the RMF.
* ``"fov"``: The field of view in arcminutes. 
* ``"focal_length"``: The focal length of the telescope in meters.
* ``"dither"``: Whether or not the instrument dithers by default. 

As SOXS matures, this list of specifications will likely expand, and the number of options for 
some of them (e.g., the PSF) will also expand.

Making Custom Instruments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make a custom instrument, you can take an existing instrument specification and modify it, giving
it a new name, or write a new specification to a `JSON <http://www.json.org>`_ file and read it in. To
make a new specification from a dictionary, construct the dictionary and feed it to 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.add_instrument_to_registry`. For example, if you wanted to take the default 
calorimeter specification and change the plate scale, you would do it this way, using 
:func:`~soxs.instrument.get_instrument_from_registry` to get the specification so that you can alter it:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import get_instrument_from_registry, add_instrument_to_registry
    new_mucal = get_instrument_from_registry("mucal")
    new_mucal["name"] = "mucal_high_res" # Must change the name, otherwise an error will be thrown
    new_mucal["num_pixels"] = 12000 # Results in an ambitiously smaller plate scale, 0.1 arcsec per pixel
    name = add_instrument_to_registry(new_mucal)
    
You can also store an instrument specification in a JSON file and import it:

.. code-block:: python

    name = add_instrument_to_registry("my_mucal.json")
    
You can download an example instrument specification JSON file `here <../example_mucal_spec.json>`_. 

You can also take an existing instrument specification and write it to a JSON file for editing
using :func:`~soxs.instrument.write_instrument_json`:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import write_instrument_json
    # Using the "new_mucal" from above
    write_instrument_json("mucal_high_res", "mucal_high_res.json")

Instrument specifications in JSON files can be supplied as the instrument argument to
:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`, and they will be automatically added to
the registry:

.. code-block:: python

    instrument = "my_imager.json"
    instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, instrument, sky_center, clobber=True)
